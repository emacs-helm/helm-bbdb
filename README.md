# Related project

[Addressbook bookmark](https://github.com/thierryvolpiatto/addressbook-bookmark) is a contact manager for emacs similar to `bbdb` but much lighter (only one file `addressbook-bookmark.el`) and without all the `bbdb` features you will never use. It provides completion in message-mode buffers using the helm interface, which is how helm works out of the box with M-x `helm-addressbook-bookmarks`.  Contacts are stored in emacs bookmark file, which means the database format is much simpler and lighter than `bbdb`'s database.
