[Addressbook bookmark](https://github.com/thierryvolpiatto/addressbook-bookmark) is
a contact manager for emacs similar to `bbdb` but much more light (only
one file `addressbook-bookmark.el`) without all the `bbdb` features you
will never use, it provide completion in email buffers, its helm
interface is part of helm and works out of the box with M-x
`helm-addressbook-bookmarks`.  Contacts are stored in emacs bookmark
file, so the database format is also much simpler and lighter than `bbdb`
one.
